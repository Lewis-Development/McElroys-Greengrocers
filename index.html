We are proud to support local suppliers and have a number of farmers who supply us with fresh, local and seasonal produce. To name one, John Hamilton from Comber, Co. Down, supplies us all year round with vegetables and potatoes. We have been selling his Comber Earlies for well over twenty years. Another local product which proves popular is Philip Earls' local honey which we have delivered fresh every week. People come from all over Belfast especially to buy it. John Sloan from Lisburn provides us with his carrots and parsnips which we start selling as soon as they are harvested. Over the summer months we get our Strawberries from Seamus Donnelly in Dungannon, as he has both early and late crops. Later victoria plums arrive. Local peas, broad beans and beetroot are all popular.</p>

			<p class="large center"><span class="quote">"</span> A great local place for fruit and veg. Always a great selection. <span class="quote">"</span></p>

			<div class="line"></div>

			<p class="center"><span class="quote">"</span> Traditional fruit and vegetable shop in Ballyhackamore, decent sized shop with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables on sale. I like the way almost every fruit and veg is labelled with what country they are from, good prices , brilliant outdoor display of fruit and veg. You can buy hampers in here made to your choice of fruit and veg. Also sell local homemade jams, chutneys and fudge. Theres a section where you can get some half price fruit and free scraps of veg for your rabbit or animals. I like this shop I regularly shop In here, staff are friendly and helpful. <span class="quote">"</span></p>

			<div class="line"></div>

			<p class="center"><span class="quote">"</span> McElroy's screams traditional - from it's hand painted shop front to the on street wooden crates it doesn't get much more old school than this fruit and veg shop. Located on the Upper Newtownards Road McElroy's is a Belfast stalwart and with good reason. It hasn't changed much over the years because it's focus has always been on providing fresh local produce and that's what they continue you to do. If you like your fruit and veg in minimal packaging and your spuds still covered in mud then look no further than McElroy's. All their veg is sold at farm prices so you'll be sure to pick up a bargain.  There's so much greenery in store that one visit is bound to make you happier and healthier. <span class="quote">"</span></p>

			<div class="line"></div>

			<p class="center"><span class="quote">"</span> This is my local fruit and veg shop in ballyhackamore. I shop here regularly, their produce is always better quality and great tasting compared to some for the big shops. They also make fruit baskets a big hit. <span class="quote">"</span></p>

			<div class="line"></div>

			<p class="center"><span class="quote">"</span> Great quality produce, excellent value for money and friendly / helpful staff. I would recommend coming here over anywhere else for your fruit and vegetables. They had great quality and good sized pumpkins too for Halloween. I used to go to McElroy’s all the time with my granny when I was a kid - still hasn't changed. Best fruit and veg shop around. <span class="quote">"</span></p>
